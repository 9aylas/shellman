# discord_frontend
`discord_frontend` is a frontend module for `shellman`. The idea is that it lets you (and your team) control your `shellman` reverse shells over Discord. Also, we like using Discord as 
[@excusemewtf_ctf][excusemewtf].

## Usage
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You can then run `shellman`. It will ask for all the required config. You can run `!help` in the chosen "main channel"
to get information regarding the commands.


## Configuration
To use `discord_frontend`, create a new server or be a part of a Discord server where you are an admin. Afterwards go to 
[Discord Developer Portal][Discord Developer Portal] and create a new application. In your application's settings, go 
to the `Bot` tab and turn your application into a bot. Then optionally (if you want to enable admin mode), go to the 
`OAuth` tab and tick `Bot` in `Scopes` and `Administrator` in `Bot Permissions`. Then, use the generated link to add the
bot to your server.

Finally, copy `Token` in `Bot` tab of [Discord Developer Portal][Discord Developer Portal] and paste the said info when 
asked.

## An explanation of "admin mode"
In admin mode, `discord_frontend` will automatically listen to each new `shellman` connection, and create a channel for 
it in the configured category with a name created by running the `channel_scheme` configured as a Python f-string. 

The commands `!clear`, `!rename`, `!catreset` are only enabled in admin mode.

The bot likely doesn't actually need the "Administrator" permission - the "Manage Channels" permission should be enough,
although we've only tested with "Administrator", and the security impact of compromise wouldn't be very different.
